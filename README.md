# ANGMAR: Augmented Network of Ground-based Magnetometers for Adaptive Refinement

ANGMAR is a scientific initiative aimed at enhancing existing geomagnetic observation networks through the deployment of low-cost, ground-based magnetometers. By strategically filling spatial gaps in current arrays, ANGMAR provides improved regional coverage and higher spatial resolution for studies of ionospheric electrodynamics, space weather, and geomagnetic phenomena.

This repository contains tools, firmware, and data processing routines developed for the design, deployment, and operation of the ANGMAR network. The project emphasizes modularity, autonomy, and adaptability, making it suitable for both high-latitude and mid-latitude installations.
